Chacha is a **productivity-first command-line assistant** designed to help developers manage Git workflows and AI-assisted tasks without leaving their terminal. The CLI wraps common development operations — such as crafting commit messages, explaining code, and fixing files — behind intuitive commands to speed up everyday workflows.


At its core, Chacha delivers tools that integrate with Git and AI services. For example, you can stage files interactively, generate context-aware commit messages, and summarize diffs or PDFs using your configured AI provider directly from the shell. :contentReference

Chacha was built with Python, leveraging packages like Click for command handling and Questionary for interactive prompts. It also integrates optional AI providers — such as Anthropic’s Claude or Google’s Gemini — configurable via environment variables.
