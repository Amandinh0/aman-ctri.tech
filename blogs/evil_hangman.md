I created a dynamic version of the classic Hangman game using C, where the target word changes unpredictably to keep the game engaging. To achieve this, I designed and implemented a custom algorithm that maximizes the game's unpredictability, ensuring that each playthrough offers a unique challenge.

The development process was carried out on Ubuntu Linux, with Vim as my primary text editor, highlighting my comfort and efficiency with command-line tools. This project not only improved my skills in C programming but also demonstrated my ability to tackle complex problems and adapt to different development environments.
