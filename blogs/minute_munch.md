As a team, we designed and developed a comprehensive food delivery platform tailored for the UMass Amherst community. This platform streamlined order management by integrating precise cost calculations based on distance and providing food menus from the four campus dining halls.

We utilized MongoDB for efficient data management, storing information on menu items, residence halls, and orders. This integration ensured smooth data retrieval and management. The platform also featured CRUD operations for orders through RESTful endpoints, allowing drivers to manage deliveries in real-time and see new orders on their feed.

React Routing was employed to segment the website into distinct sections for drivers and customers, making it easy for drivers to view pending orders and for customers to place new ones. Throughout the development process, we used Git and GitHub for version control, which facilitated collaborative development and maintained the project's integrity.
