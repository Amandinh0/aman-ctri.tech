description: "Everyone has seen memes about C and the segmentation fault. But from my experience with C during my first year
of college, I can really appreciate it more. A small blog on why I think everyone should try to learn C, even if they are familiar wth high-level language that is 'faster'."

<h1 class="blog-titles">Why Everyone Should Learn C</h1>

C is a fundamental programming language that has influenced many others and is crucial for understanding how computers work at a low level. While languages like Python are highly abstracted and user-friendly and seem faster, knowing what is going on behind the scences, or just having an idea will make one a lot better at programming

<h1 class="blog-titles">Python vs C</h1>

I learned Python to get better at technical interviews. Its concise notation really makes it ideal for coding up complex
algorithms quickly. But one of the biggest reasons I felt comfortable using it, is because I had an idea what is going on behind the scence. Someone that jsut start with python knows how a loop works

```python
for x in range(5):
    print(x)

```

I definitely wouldn't try to find out more than this. But there is some kind of manual check and iterations going on.

```C
for(int i = 0; i < 10, i++){
    //execute your code
}
```

The second method:
    - Starts with i at 0. check if it is less than 10, increments it 
    - it does this until the second statment is not satisfied

<h1 class="blog-titles">Why is this important?</h1>

One may say that this is a very trivial thing which is taken care by Python. Which is true, there are a lot more ocmplex things that higher level languages and frameworks take care of. But from my experience, I have always been able to write better code and debug code better when I kind of have an idea of how things are working behind the scences.
